# ONSE
One Nation Secure Election

## Problem:
In every election, the voting turnout is less than 50% in some areas. Voters not being able to attend their respective constituencies is one of the main reason for this problem. We aim to solve this problem by giving the user freedom to vote from anywhere in India. We believe this can drastically increase the voting turnout.

## Solution:
We aim to build an online service portal which will be deployed across all the voting centers. When the respective voter goes to one of the service center,once he authenticates himself,his constituency ballot will be displayed where he can vote securely akin to the EVM'S. All the votes coming from every voting centre will be stored in a blockchain using Azure blockchain to make the data secure and valid.
### Features:
- Online service portal in voting centers
- Prevention of duplicated votes
- Realtime analytics of voter turnout on the internet
- Instant results after the election stops
- Comfort in voting

## Feasibility:
Deploying this online portal in every voting booth may be difficult. Hence, we need to ensure that the EVMs are linked to our blockchain so that EVMs can be used where online portal is difficult to deploy.
