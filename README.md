# ONSE
One Nation Secure Election

## Problem:
In every election, the voting turnout is less than 50% in some areas. Voter not being able to attend his constituency is one of the main reason for this problem. We aim to solve this problem by giving the user freedom to vote from anywhere in India. We believe this can drastically increase the voting turnout from less than 50% to almost 90%.

## Solution:
We will build an online voting portal which will be deployed across all the voting centers. The voter can go to his nearest voting centre and cast the vote for his own constituency. All the votes coming from every voting centre will be stored in a blockchain using Azure blockchain to make the data secure and valid.
### Features:
- Online portal in voting centers
- Prevention of multiple votes
- Realtime analytics of voter turnout on the internet
- Instant results after the election stops

## Feasibility:
Deploying this online portal in every voting booth may be difficult. Hence, we need to ensure that the EVMs are linked to our blockchain so that EVMs can be used where online portal is difficult to deploy.
